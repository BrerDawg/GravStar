Move mouse to top of window to reveal menu, there you can adjust Edit->Preferences

This game has no sound effects.

'left/right cursor keys' for rotation
'up cursor' for thrust
'ctrl' to fire ammo
'shift' for chaff, deploy these sparingly as they add to your damage.
'space' for missile, deploy these sparingly as they add to your damage.

'p' for pause

'm' to add meteor (asteroid)

'g' to add a gravity obj

'b' to add a magnetic mine obj

'0' disable damage, see futher below

You are yellow, cpu is green.

Ship to ship collisions add to your damage, too much damage stops access to missiles/chaff and will destroy a ship when it reaches 100%.

Watch out for the homing missle, yours and theirs, they take a short while to arm once in flight, and they are fatal if struck, use chaff counter measure to divert cpu's missile.

Collisions with meteor can be fatal.

Damage is repaired slowly over time, your damage is also shown as a red bar at bottom of window, it will flash when critical.

To repair all damage, wait for the 'medic' cross to appear and try to meet with it.

Missiles and chaff deployment add to your damage, they won't be avail if your damage is near 100%.

Collect magnetic mines by passing slowly by them, your hold on them is tenuous and they can be lost via high speed or enemy ship proximity, fire them at a distant cpu ship to cause a fragment cloud, these will damage cpu ship, but fragments you create will also damage your ship.

If you get caught by a grav object, try applying thrust at opportune times to build up momentum in the same direction (a bit like pushing a playground swing).



'z' launch an enemy missile.


Try '0' to disable deaths (damage figures will disappear),  this enables unlimited resources, keep pressing 'space' and 'z' to see a missile storm, creates nice swirling patterns.
Add some meteors with 'm' and grav objs with 'g'.




Config
~~~~~~
Edit 'open_editor.sh' and specify your favourite text edit, this will allow the opening of 'help.txt' while program is running.
e.g: gedit $1&

give 'open_editor.sh' exec permissions:
sudo chmod 777 open_editor.sh


You can force where the config file should be read/stored and what its name should be, like this: 
./gravstar --cf ~/.gravstar.ini
